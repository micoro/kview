%% *KView*
% This toolbox provides some instruments to easly visualize and manage data in the form of arrays. One of the main application is to manage signals 
% from phisical tests or simulations, but in general it can be used to handle any variable that is represented as a one-dimensional array in matlab.


%% Overview
% The biggest part of the toolbox is represented by the <GUI.html GUI>. The GUI gives a fast way to plot and manage many variables at the same time.
% It's possibile to set different variables for the X and Y axis and plot more of them together just selecting them on the listbox.
% This way it is possible to do with just one click many operations that would have been boring and would have stolen more time than that they deserved.
%
% The KView GUI also gives the user some power to customize it, like adding buttons for certain functions or even adding customized panels to the GUI. 
%
% Many functions used by the GUI are also available to be used directly as matlab commands; and the KView itself can be managed throught matlab commands (from the 
% command window, scripts or functions) giving a lot of flexibility to the user to automate many operations.
